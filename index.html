  Root HTML document for the SecureCodeHub single-page app.

  Notes for developers:
  - Vite uses this file as the template during dev and build.
  - React mounts inside <div id="root">.
  - Keep global meta, favicons, and CSP here.
  - External scripts loaded as modules are included below; evaluate and
    remove any third-party scripts you do not need.
